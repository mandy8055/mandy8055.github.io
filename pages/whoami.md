# About Me

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :cowboy_hat_face:,<br>
I work under the acronym "mandy8055" across the virtual world. A student with insatiable desire to learn, jack of all trades but master of none, true patriot, motivator in the morning, fitness freak in the evening and programmer-cum-developer in night. I enjoy working on new technology and challenging problem statements. I love helping people solve their problem on github and stackoverflow.
